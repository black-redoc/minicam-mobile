# minicam-mobile
Native mobile clients (Android + iOS) for a self-hosted [minicam](https://github.com/black-redoc/minicam)
instance. A user points the app at their own minicam server (LAN over HTTP, or WAN through
Cloudflare Tunnel + Access), logs in with their minicam account, watches the cameras they are
allowed to see and drives PTZ. The apps never talk to any service other than the user's own
minicam host and their Cloudflare Access login page.

## Current focus
Milestone: M1 - Viewer v1 · Spec: specs/001-viewer-v1.md · Next step: install the toolchains
(see DEVELOPMENT.md), generate the Gradle wrapper and the Xcode project, and get both apps
building; in parallel, land the backend endpoints from specs/002-backend-mobile-endpoints.md
in the minicam repo.
