# minicam-mobile
Native mobile clients (Android + iOS) for a self-hosted [minicam](https://github.com/black-redoc/minicam)
instance. A user points the app at their own minicam server (LAN over HTTP, or WAN through
Cloudflare Tunnel + Access), logs in with their minicam account, watches the cameras they are
allowed to see and drives PTZ. The apps never talk to any service other than the user's own
minicam host and their Cloudflare Access login page.

## Current focus
Milestone: M2.13 - In-app QR scanner · ADR 0012 (after M2.12, ADR 0011) · Next step: scan the
dashboard QR on real phones once minicam-admin #4 and minicam #42 are deployed. Earlier: M2.10
manual AC4/AC5; M2.8 HEVC check; M1 device checks (specs/001, 004).
